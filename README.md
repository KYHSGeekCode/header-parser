# header-parser
Extracts simple tags from a C++ header. Calls back onto an interface when a certain element is encountered.

# Use cases

I have found a lot of use cases for something like this. Some of these include: 

* Serialization (binary and text based)
* Script bindings
* Remote procedure calls
* Generating models (for other languages)
* Reflection

I plan to create several tools using this library to do the above.
